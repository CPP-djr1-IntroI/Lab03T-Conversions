## Intro to C++ I Lab 03

Conversions

**Date assigned:** 

**Program due:**

**Points:** 

**This is an individual assignment.**

**Goals:**

1.  Work with Visual Studio to create additional projects in a single solution

2.  Convert algebraic problems into C++ solutions

**Lab 3.1**

Write a program to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to a Celsius temperature. 
The algebraic formula for this conversion is C = 5/9(F-32).
Here is exactly what your program is to output (asterisks and all), and
user input is in **bold**. All variables are to be a double.

<pre>
*********************
 Temperature Converter
 *********************

 Enter a non-negative Fahrenheit temperature: <b>212.0</b>
 
 212 Fahrenheit is 100 Celsius
</pre>

**Lab 3.2**

Add a project called TimeConverter to your Lab03 solution. 
This project is to convert a number of seconds into hours, minutes, 
and seconds in a format like HH:MM:SS.

Sample Input / Output where the total number of seconds is the 
only input shown in bold below.


<pre>
**************
Time Converter  
**************

Enter seconds since day began: <b>100</b>

The time is 0:1:40

</pre>

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab03 Link on The C++ Tutorials in the section Data Input to accept this
        assignment as we've done before. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to each project specified above. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab03.pdf) of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
